## 1. Released classes

### 1.1 Jester Twins

**Swing?** Please refer to the official ruling on [Swing](#-swing) for more information. As a rule of thumb, you **cannot** change directions when swinging an enemy. Swing **is** affected by icy terrains, the target move in the direction of the point of movement that moved them into the icy terrain, when they exited icy terrains, you can resume swinging with the new relative distance. 

**What happens when the scenario effects, road events or outpost events force characters to gain a condition?** Both Twins gain the condition. Curse (and Bless, if applicable) will apply twice.

**What happens when the scenario effects force characters to add a -1 modifier to their deck?** You only add one -1 card.

**Can I switch the position of the twins when they're stacked?** No, the Twins need to be unstacked then stacked again to be able to change position.

**What happens in an escape scenario?** Both the twin need to escape in order for the scenario to be completed. When they are stacked, they can escape through the same hex.

**Items?** Either twin can activate items to perform/gain the benefits written on the item. Items with use slot are triggered by both twins. Items with passive bonuses are gained by both twins. Here are a list of FH items that are potentially confusing:

## 2. Custom conditions and effects

### <img src="assets/conditions-and-effects/Swing.svg" width="32" height="32" > SWING

**Swing** is a forced movement ability similar to **push** or **pull** except its movement is ***around*** the acting figure rather rather than away or towards. When any figure performs "**Swing X**", the target is forced to move up to X hexes in a single direction, clockwise or counterclockwise. Each individual hex entered must maintain the ***same*** distance between the target and the acting figure.

As with push and pull, **swing** is unaffected by difficult terrain, but all other normal movement rules are still applied, and if there are no more valid hexes for the target to enter, the **swing** ends.

Any figure immune to forced movement is immune to **swing**, but immobilized or stunned figures can still be **swung**.

A figure can only target enemies with **swing** unless otherwise specified.

Multiple **swing** effects are combined. For example, if an ability with "**swing 1**" gains "**swing 2**," the results is a "**swing 3**" ability.

It is possible for the target to change their distance to the acting figure ***during*** the **swing** such as in the case of a non-flying target being **swung** into a hex with icy terrain. In such a case the **swing** may continue in the same direction and at the new distance.
